  <h1>The Banned Books Series</h1>
  <p><em>A public art project confronting book bans through visual storytelling</em></p>

  <p>Each of these paintings represents a book that has been banned; most were banned by the United States Naval Academy and are now targeted in schools, libraries, and other institutions across the U.S. These books represent the rich diversity of race, culture, self-expression, and beliefs that is being silenced by threats to intellectual freedom and democracy itself. Some of them tell the stories of communities the U.S. has failed, over and over again, as they built our nation into what it is. Some of them tell of those who hid in the shadows to survive, then came into the light with the promise of equality, only to be threatened with un-personhood again. Some are mere entertainment, but contain plotlines and characters that give authentic glimpses into the human mind and heart. </p> <p> Please, keep reading. Keep questioning. Keep thinking.  </p>
